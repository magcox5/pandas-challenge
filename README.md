# pandas-challenge
Use python/pandas to analyze school data 
In the PyCitySchools challenge, a couple of observations about the data are:
1. Higher spending per student didn't result in higher test scores, as the worst performing schools often spent more than the best performing schools.
2. Smaller schools had higher test scores, and the charter schools were generally smaller than the public schools.
(It might be interesting to see what average household income and parent education level are by school, because that might correlate better with student achievement)
